I am currently working as a front office Quantitative Analyst within Financial Markets at ING Bank in Amsterdam. At ING, I focus on pricing and risk management of financial derivatives using mathematical modelling and data-driven techniques.

I have a joint position as a Research Scientist at Computational Science Lab within Informatics Institute, University of Amsterdam. At UvA, the primary focus of my research is network-based techniques in finance for trading and credit risk management. I am associated with H2020 EU BigData Finance project: Machine Learning for Trading and Risk Management.

I did my PhD in Mathematics at Institute for Logic, Language and Computation, University of Amsterdam, and Integrated Masters in Mathematics and Scientific Computing from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur, India.
